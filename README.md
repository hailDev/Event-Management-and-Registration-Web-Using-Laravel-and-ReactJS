# Event-Management-and-Registration-Web-Using-Laravel-and-ReactJS
I made this project to fulfill the miniproject 2 course from my college, feel free if you want to use as reference. If there is a question you can contact me.

note:
1. On ".env" file you can change the email with yours as web email for verification requirement
2. Don't forget to install the node JS on this project, because i didn't put it in

Thank You
